# MMHWI-SSS (Monster Hunter World Iceborne - Skill Set Search)

### First of all the features
- Search function by adding Armor skills
- Exclude function for different parameters. e.g Armor piece, Master/High/Low etc.
- Use built in deco or upload your own deco function
- Saving an armor set
### Specs
- Going to be a static website (HTML, Tailwind CLI, JS)
- We are going to consume this https://mhw-db.com/
- If possible I want offline version. Basically I'll get the data we need in the API then just turn it into JSON
- Desktop first then Mobile. I want it usable for my sake
- If possible if I manage to finish this lets use this as a base for MH Wilds
### Problems so far
- Bro I am not a coding genius this is a big algo
